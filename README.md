# Advent of Code Solutions
This repository contains my solutions for [Advent of Code 2024](https://adventofcode.com/) challenges.

## Structure

- `solutions/`: Contains solution files organized by day
- `inputs/`: Contains input files for each day
- `utils/`: Contains utility functions used across multiple solutions
- `tests/`: Contains test files

## Setup

1. Create a virtual environment:
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running Solutions

Each day's solution can be run from its respective file in the `solutions` directory:

```bash
python -m solutions.day01.solution
```

## Running Tests

```bash
pytest tests/
```
